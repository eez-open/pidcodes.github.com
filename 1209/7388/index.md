The AIOC ("All-In-One-Cable) is an ecosystem of small-form-factor adapters with USB Type-C connectors to allow ham radio operators to connect their radios to a computer.
It enumerates itself as different USB classes, such as a sound-card (e.g. for APRS purposes) and a virtual tty ("COM Port") for programming/control and asserting the PTT (Push-To-Talk).

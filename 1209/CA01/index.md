CANnectivity is an open source firmware for Universal Serial Bus (USB)
to Controller Area Network (CAN) adapters.

The firmware implements the Geschwister Schneider USB/CAN device
protocol (often referred to as "gs_usb"). This protocol is supported
by the Linux kernel SocketCAN gs_usb driver, by python-can, and by
many other software packages.

The firmware, which is based on the Zephyr RTOS, allows turning your
favorite microcontroller development board into a full-fledged USB to
CAN adapter.

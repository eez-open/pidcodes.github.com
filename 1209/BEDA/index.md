The project is designed to provide instant messaging over a long distance using LoRa by connecting a special Device equipped with a LoRa radio module to a smartphone/laptop/computer ("Host") via USB. In conjunction with the Host, it also serves as a single-channel LoRa gateway for Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

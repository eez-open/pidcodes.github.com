A small digital multimeter that is designed as a badge add-on, following the SAO v1.69 specification. It is using the Raspberry Pi RP2040 and features a small OLED screen, rotating knob, function button and probe terminals, all housed in a 3D printed case.

The firmware is using CircuitPython and the code can easily be hacked, by connecting via USB-C to the RP2040.

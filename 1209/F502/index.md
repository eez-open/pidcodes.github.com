RP2040-Shim for PoE-FeatherWing, functionally equivalent to Feather RP2040 but physically shaped to allow mounting on top of the PoE-FeatherWing.
Differences from Feather RP2040 include USB micro B versus USB Type C connector, no battery and charging circuit, 2MB flash and no Qwiic / STEMMA QT connector.

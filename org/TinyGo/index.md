TinyGo brings the Go programming language to embedded systems and to the modern
web by creating a new compiler based on LLVM.

You can compile and run TinyGo programs on over 60 different microcontroller 
boards such as the BBC micro:bit and the Arduino Uno.

TinyGo can also produce WebAssembly (WASM) code which is very compact in size.
You can compile programs for web browsers, as well as for server and edge 
computing environments that support the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)
family of interfaces.

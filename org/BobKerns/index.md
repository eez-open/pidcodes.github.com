Bob Kerns is a retired computer language, AI, and full-stack web developer who after a half century is returning to his roots and hacking some hardware, as well as doing some minor scicomm:

* Power grid and renewable energy
* Epidemiology and modelling
* Political and historical data presentation

At MIT in the 1970s, Bob was  a member of the Macsyma project, a maintainer of MacLisp and developer of VAX/NIL. He created TEACH;LISP, an online tutoring/learning environment for the Lisp language.

Bob is also a musician who used to hack MIDI in Apple Common Lisp on his Mac II, controlling his Yamaha DX-7, and in the early 1970s was designing a digital synthesizer, a little too far ahead of the curve.

Clearly, Bob is a generalist with too many projects on his plate!
